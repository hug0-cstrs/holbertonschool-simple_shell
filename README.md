# :mortar_board: C - Simple Shell

Second group project at Holberton School : implement our own simplified version of a UNIX command line interpreter in C.


## Description :scroll:

The objective of this project is to create from scratch a simple UNIX command interpreter with limited functionality but applying the core concepts of a more robust shell. In simple words, the shell is a program that takes commands from the keyboard and gives them to the operating system to perform. It incorporates many features and generally executes other commands.
